# Flashcards
Python Project that I'm slowly trying to flesh out with more features into a better quiz game 



Questions I have for myself, I guess?:

### git

I've been learning a lot about Git with this project 
and I keep wondering little things as I'm using github 
- if working on file remotely in a repo on github, does it make more sense to make a local copy of files in question, or just work on them remotely to commit changes?

If the repo was massive, I can see how it'd all be a pain

- So should I usually be working locally or remotely on files?

### Python 
Wouldn't I want to make a venv or conda env because I'm probably gonna be using packages? How to do? When to do?

should I be more Object oriented with this and split things up into maybe a function class or two, for neatness?

how can i parse json files with different formatting?
